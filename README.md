I took Introduction to Java Programming CS111A at City College of San Francisco. 

I got an F in the class. I was very unhappy with the class, the materials that were provided by the school, the 4 hour lectures etc. 

I didn't learn very much from the class. 

I was pursuing a Andriod App Programming Certificate which consists of Introduction to Java Programming CS111A, Fundamentals to Java Programming CS111B,Introduction to Android App Programming CS211A, Advanced Android App Programming CS311A. 

I started looking and asking classmates about outside learning material and resources since i was unhappy with what the school was providing. 

One of my classmates directed me towards Learn Java the Hard Way by Graham Mitchell. 

I bought the entire package consisting of PDFs Learn Java the Hard Way by Graham Mitchell, Learn Object Oriented Programming the Hard Way by Graham Mitchell, Tutorial videos and source code files for Learn Java the Hard Way and Learn OOP the Hard Way. 

I spent 2 months working on this course. I signed up for another CS111A Introduction to Java Programming Class with a different teacher. 

Afterwards, i was able to complete all of the assignemnts in my 2nd Introduction to Java Programming class without any instuction from the teacher or using any of the teachers provided material or the required text book. 

Approaching the Finals i was getting an A in the class. I didn't completely finish LJTHW because the semester started. 

Despite not finishing it made a huge difference and i actually learned something.
