Learn Java the Hard Way by Graham Mitchell is a Book with  a series of Lessons with Study Drills at the end of them. The user reads along and types out all of the code into a basic text editor like Notepad++ and then manually changes, compiles and runs the code per the direction of the Study Drills.

There are a total of 58 lessons. I uploaded the lessons where i did make changes. Some of them required no changes to be
made and therefore aren't listed. 

All assignments were entered in as original source code from author and the changes i made afters. There are branches for every assignment so that the merge request and changes can be viewed.
