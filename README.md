Learn Java the Hard Way by Graham Mitchell is a Book with  a series of Lessons with Study Drills at the end of them. The user reads along and types out all of the code into a basic text editor like Notepad++ and then manually changes, compiles and runs the code per the direction of the Study Drills. 

Inside of this repository are of my lessons from LJTHW.
